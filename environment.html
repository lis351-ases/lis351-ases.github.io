		<h2>Where do I write, compile, and run my code?</h2>
		
		<p>
		Text editors and IDEs are where you will work on your code. Text editors are very bare bones and won't provide you with much besides a place to write your code. 
		This simplicity has the added benefit of being able to use one environment to write programs for many different languages. IDEs have a lot of quality of life features
		which help you to write and implement code much more efficiently. The downside is that they are usually limited to one language per IDE. I will now list some text editors 
		and IDEs that I recommend:
		</p>
		
		<h3>Text Editors:</h3>
		
		<dl>
			<dt>Notepad++</dt>
			<dd>This is a free text editor that allows you to write code for many different languages and file types. Great if you plan on learning a bunch of coding languages</dd>
			<dt>VSCode</dt>
			<dd>
			This is the perfect middle ground between text editor and IDE. It allows for a lot of customization so you can build it to be something similar to an IDE with
			many different features, or you can just use it as a versatile text editor like Notepad++	
			</dd>
		</dl>
		
		<h3>IDEs:</h3>
		
		<dl>
			<dt>Intellij</dt>
			<dd>Widely considered the definitive IDE for Java programming by many Java developers. They have a free community version that still retains a lot of the useful features.</dd>
			<dt>Visual Studio</dt>
			<dd>
			Not to be confused with VSCode, Visual Studio is a full blown IDE that is mostly used for coding in C#. They also have a free community version.
