		<h3>C is a useful low level language that you will likely encounter while studying CS. Here's some info about it:</h3>

		When you want to create variables on the heap(dynamically allocated), then you have to allocate the memory you are going to use yourself. Make sure to free up any memory
		you request with allocator methods like malloc(), otherwise you'll end up with memory leaks. A memory leak is basically like going out to a restaurant, making a mess at your table,
		and leaving without cleaning it up. When you're done eating, someone else has to sit there, so you don't want to leave a mess. Similarly, when your program is done, you don't want to leave
		all those values you were using in memory, as other programs also have to use that same heap memory.

		Pointers are a infamous problem area for many people learning C. To avoid confusion and overcomplicating things, keep in mind that a pointer is just a variable that
		stores the address of somewhere else in memory. You can access what's at that address by dereferencing the pointer to it.
